# OCTRA libraries

**WIP** This sections shows an overview of all custom libraries used by OCTRA:

- components: Angular components e.g. for the signal displays.
- annotation: Objects and other classes used to handle annotation tasks
- media: all media related classes (for now audio only: audio playback a.s.o)
- utilities: library with custom functions used in the other libraries and OCTRA
